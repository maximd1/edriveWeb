TEXT_ABOUT_EDRIVE=edrive project - is an integrated automotive complex, which is being developing under the CarPC conception.

<h3>System architecture</h4>\n \
<br/>\n \
<p>edrive plays on Intel Kaby Lake platform with several applications maintaining it.</p>\n \
\n \
<h4>1. Hardware</h4>\n \
<br/>\n\n \
<p>Computer built from the following components:</p>\n\n \
<ul>\n \
 <li>CPU - Intel Pentium G4620</li>\n \
 <li>Motherboard - Gigabyte GA-H110N</li>\n \
 <li>RAM - 8GB DDR4 2400 Mhz</li>\n \
 <li>Storage: 1xSSD 60GB + 1xHDD 1TB</li>\n \
 <li>Network: Intel 7265AC WiFi + built-in 1GbE, 3G modem ZTE MF192</li>\n \
 <li>GPS receiver</li>\n \
</ul>\n \
\n \
<h4>2. Software</h4>\n \
<br/>\n \
<ul>\n \
<li>OS: Fedora Core 27 x64</li>\n \
<li>GPS-application: edrive nmeaProcessor</li>\n \
<li>Web-app: edrive WS/Web apps</li>\n \
<li>Cloud service: ownCloud</li>\n \
<li>Media apps: miniDLNA+Samba, Android-clients with SMB/DLNA support</li>\n \
</ul>\n \
\n \
<h4>3. Architectural features</h4>\n\n \
<br/>\n \
<p>nmeaProcessor receives current GPS position and sends it into the web-service, which saves them into the database. Database replicates to a stand-by server for processing and analysis. Web-application allows to manipulate tracks, monitor current GPS position of the car, maintain edrive system etc.\n \
In case of web-service issues or connectivity problems, nmeaProcessor saves coordinates into the backlog-file, which is automatically synchronized with cloud service after the resolving of connection problems.</p>\n \
\n \
<h4>4. Media device</h4>\n\n \
<br/>\n \
<p>Integration of edrive with cloud storage allows to synchronize home media-libraries with a car. After the sync, content is available for any device supporting SMB/DLNA protocols, by WiFi.</p>
TEXT_STATIC_TRACK_LIST=<p>There is a list of tracks, saved from GPS-navigation program, or taken from the car\'s GPS-receiver.\n \
Track's data contains of start date&time, mileage (in km), average speed in km/h and a car where track was saved.</p>\n\
<p><a href="#trackActionsDescriptionHolder" class="showTrackActionsHelp">Available actions...></a>\n \
<div id="trackActionsDescriptionHolder">\n \
<ul>\n\
 <li>View (link to particular track - in the name)</li>\n\
 <li>Read only - track is not available for merge (but it can be deleted)</li>\n\
 <li>Public - track is available for public review</li>\n\
</ul>\n\
</p>\n\
<br/>
TEXT_STATIC_SINGLE_TRACK=Track, saved from GPS-navigation program, or saved from car's GPS-receiver.\n\
<p><a href="#trackActionsDescriptionHolder" class="showTrackActionsHelp">Available actions...></a>\n \

TEXT_STATIC_MERGE_TRACK=
TEXT_HOME_PLAN_ROUTE_INSTRUCTIONS=Enter any locations, for instance, London - and choose corresponding one from the dropdown list. Click on "+" if you need more (or on "-", if you want to delete it). If you need to start from the latest position, click on the "Start from the current position", login and choose your car from the dropdown list - its latest position will be used as a start for the route planning. "Clear" resets form to the initial state. "Search" begins the route planning.
TEXT_HOME_PLAN_ROUTE_INSTRUCTIONS_SHORT=Plan your trip all over the Ukraine, from A to Z, anywhere from the latest position of your car.
